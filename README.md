## About

This is my personal website, it is written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), it uses jekyll to generate the site, and for the template I am using [Tailpages](https://github.com/harrywang/tailpages) by [Harry Wang](http://harrywang.me/). The site is hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), and I am using Github actions to deploy the site, create issues to track the content for my weekly review, and create a weekly post.
