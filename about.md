Hi, my name is Luis G. Natera Orozco. I am **Geospatial Network Scientist**, currently working as a Python Developer at [SYSTEMIQ](https://systemiq.earth) developing simulations for decarbonization of large scale industries. I hold a Ph.D. in Network Science at the Central European University, where I did my dissertation on [Multilayer network analysis of sustainable, multimodal urban transport networks](http://www.etd.ceu.edu/2022/natera_luis.pdf).

I am interested in the intersection between data, technology and cities. I have professional experience working in such topics, from advisory projects with universities, and local governments, to stand alone projects for private clients. This interest has lead me very interesting places, such as presenting my work at NetSci, the flagship conference of the Network Science Society, and the Future of Places conference in Stockholm.

## What's my career history?

Along my life I have worn multiple professional hats. In fact, I am an architect by training and I did designed and build a couple of houses and offices. Here are some of the hats I have worn before my current role:

### Academic

Before returning to the private sector I spent around 7 years working in different academic settings, first as an Executive coordinator for [Signa_Lab](https://signalab.mx/), a social networks research laboratory in Guadalajara, Mexico. After two years working at stabilising Signa_Lab, I moved to Budapest, Hungary to pursue my Ph.D. in Network Science. I spent four years working on multimodal urban networks and analyzing cities using large scale data and computational tools.

### Network analyst & Jack of all trades

I have worked a different startup level companies as a network and data analyst. During my time at these companies I was analyzing network data from social media sites to optimize advertising campaigns. As an early employee I was also wearing multiple hats and developing simple python tools to collect the data and automatize the analysis of such data.
