Hi, my name is Luis G. Natera Orozco. I am **Geospatial Network Scientist**, currently working as a Python Developer at [SYSTEMIQ](https://systemiq.earth) developing simulations for decarbonization of large scale industries. I hold a Ph.D. in Network Science at the Central European University, where I did my dissertation on [Multilayer network analysis of sustainable, multimodal urban transport networks](http://www.etd.ceu.edu/2022/natera_luis.pdf).

I am interested in the intersection between data, technology and cities. I have professional experience working in such topics, from advisory projects with universities, and local governments, to stand alone projects for private clients. This interest has lead me very interesting places, such as presenting my work at NetSci, the flagship conference of the Network Science Society, and the Future of Places conference in Stockholm.
