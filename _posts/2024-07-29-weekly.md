Week in review on a Tuesday. Last week was a little bit busy, on the professional side it was a normal week. Some coding, reviewing, planning and similar tasks. However, on the personal and urban sides it was an extraordinary one. I got to go to Paris for the Olympics.

We went to Paris for the weekend, and spent Friday walking around the city, getting to see some of the venues that are scatter around the center. Having the venues integrated into the city, and re-using some non-sporting places into sporting venues is a great idea. It makes the city feel part of the games, rather than just being a host and having dedicated stadiums. As it was shown during the opening ceremony, the city is indeed the stage for the games.

Personally, I really liked the way they approach the cauldron. It is very representative to have it flying over the city. Also, making sure that it is no longr burning fuel, and using a visual effect is a great idea. In 2024 burning fuel for two weeks straight is not a good idea.

Saturday was a day of tennis. We got to see some matches at Roland-Garros, and it was a great experience. We were very fortunate as we got great seats, and great matches. Along some of the players that were playing, we got to see Jasmine Paolini, who recently got to the Wimbledon final; Carlos Alcaraz, who won the last Wimbledon; and the doubles match of the US team, with Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula. The surprise of the day was the match between Jacqueline Cristian vs. Caroline Garcia, where the Romanian player won in a very close match. It was a great day of tennis.

Finally, Sunday was a day to walk around the city, go for some good french food, and get back home. As I took my camera with me, I got to take some photos, I hope you enjoy them and the rest of the links that I found during the week.

Now I'll get back to keep watching the games. Have a great week!
