 This last week was a very active one. Work-wise it was productive, doing pair programming and taking care of some bugs, functionalities, and tests. Part of iterating between activities is also a good opportunity to learn from the other team members, take for example working alone in introducing a new functionality, then do a code review over the newly introduced code, and finally a pair programming to further think about some edge cases or to improve the readability and organization of certain areas of the app. This learning opportunities have provided me with different insights on how to improve my development and coding skills. Next week I'll be traveling to Munich to meet with the team, so it will certainly be fun and productive.

Following the technical side, this week I [wrote](https://luisnatera.com/posts/2022/9/exploring-geodata-in-python-with-geopandas/) about GeoPandas‚Äô `.explore()` method to visualize in an interactive map data from a GeoDataFrame. 

On the personal side, the week was full with family, friends, and good weather (for the first half of the week), I managed to take one dip in the canal on Monday, probably the last one of the summer/year.

Finally, on Wednesday we went to Caf√© Tacvba concert. It was a long time since the last time I saw them, and it was as good as I remembered. It was good to get back to one concert after a long time and enjoy it with friends. It also produced another effect, that day the area where the concert was felt like being back in M√©xico.


## Twitter
-  ‚úçÔ∏è [A thread about Wikipedia edits in the minutes after the death of Queen Elizabeth was announced.](https://twitter.com/depthsofwiki/status/1568101529273643008?s=21&t=8_UALUkjvskSxMKSwJnI0w) // An interesting guided tour of how the Wikipedia editors started changing the page, from updating her death date, selecting an historical picture, to editing verbs to past tense.

## Web
-  üì± [Steve Jobs Archive](https://stevejobsarchive.com/) announced by Laurene Powell Jobs as "a repository of historical materials relating to Steve, some of which have never before been made public" // Currently it contains an email from Jobs to Jobs, and some of his quotes. Looking forward on how the repository will grow. 
-  üìº [Netflix software engineering levels.](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/netflix-levels/) // Interesting insight on how Netflix used to have a flat software engineering structure, and how they changed to introduce different levels, and the implications of the change. Impressive that they managed to grow/operate with a single level to up to 2,000 engineers.
-  üßë‚Äçüíª [Pytest parametrize decorator.](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/parametrize.html) // I learned this one a couple of weeks ago, a very useful decorator in Pytest to enable parametrization of arguments for the test functions. Thus checking that an input produces the spected output. Very useful to DRY programming and test different cases.
