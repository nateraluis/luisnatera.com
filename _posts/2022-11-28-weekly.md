One more week gone, one more week in review. Last week was spent refactoring some code to use `htmx` in a more efficient way, so I got to play more with `Django` modifying views and serving the appropriate `html` response to be updated in the single page application we are building. Part of the refactoring was to use `hx-swap-oob` attributes, thus being able to swap `div` elements just by their ids. It was a nice experience.

Besides work, the weather is starting to get colder, I went to do some indoor cycling, and for the first time, reformer pilates, I was not expecting it to be so physically challenge, and it was. It was fun.

Here are the links and interesting content I found out this week:

## Mastodon
- ðŸš‡ [Robin Hawkes' thread on movement-related visualizations and his favorite ones.](https://fosstodon.org/@robhawkes/109393241074914857) // Pretty cool examples of visualizing movement.
- ðŸŒ§ [Today's poem is called 'On Falling for a Meteorologist'](https://mastodon.online/@brianbilston/109397934628138864) // Brian Bilston is posting poems in mastodon and they also have a visual component. Check it out.

## YouTube
- ðŸš™ [The high cost of parking](https://youtu.be/Akm7ik-H_7U) // Oldie but goodie, Vox's explanation on the high cost of parking, and how parking shapes our urban landscapes.
