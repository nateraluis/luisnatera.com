Last week was a short one at work, a three day week. It had some deep dives into code to make the application to work into certain specific cases. It was good to understand more about different areas of the application that I didn't develop firsthand.

Along the week I found interesting resources, both on the software side and the urban side. One special one was the McKinsey report on autonomous vehicles, [I wrote about it](https://luisnatera.com/posts/2023/01/27-autonomus-cars-are-not-the-solution-urban-sprawl/), and their take on urban sprawl. I still find amazing that TVs and electric cars keep being pitched as the solution to urban mobility, while we have had the solution in our streets since long ago: üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, üö≤, üöé.

Here are the collection of links and resources, hope you enjoy:

## Software
-  [osmnx-matplotlib-animation](https://github.com/mikhailsirenko/osmnx-matplotlib-animation) A simple example of how to animate objects moving on OSMnx graph. By [Mikhail Sirenko](https://twitter.com/mikhailsirenko) // Good tutorial on using OSMnx and Mtplotlib to animate objects moving in an urban graph. It is very useful to create visualizations of people, bikes, trams, or other objects moving through a city.

As a pedestrian, cycling, and public transport advocate, it is really frustrating to keep hearing about TVs as the solution, while clearly they are part of it, but by far they are not the most important part of the solution.
