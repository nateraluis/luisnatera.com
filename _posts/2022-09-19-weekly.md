 This week I went to Munich for work almost all the week. It was very nice to see so many people and get to together in 3D with the people I work with. 

I took the train from Amsterdam to Munich, it is a ~7 hrs ride in case the trains run on time, unfortunately they didn‚Äôt. The whole trip took around 9 hrs, having some delay on the Amsterdam departure that make me miss my connection in Mannheim. At the end it wasn‚Äôt that bad as it was during lunch time and I had lunch there.

This time in Munich also had old friends, I meet with Christopher for dinner and beers. It was nice to remember old times, and catch-up.

Work wise it was also a very intense week, multiple working sessions on different projects, getting to know more people and have really nice and interesting conversations. It was also a good opportunity to look back and reflect on the work done, take the lessons, and look ahead for the last stint of the year.

I got back to Amsterdam with an extra viruses as souvenir, COVID got me (or I got it) for a second time this year. No much symptoms at the moment, hopefully I will remain without symptoms.

-  üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [The last dak runner, by Trivik Verma](https://trivikverma.com/blog/2022-08-the-last-dak-runner/) // A fascinating story of mail delivery ultra runners in India that once used to connect remote villages in the Himalaya. Very interesting to read about the changes, and how running to deliver mail is being replaced with new roads, and to think of the impact of such roads on connecting the villages and also on how it will affect the daily rithms of life.
-  ü¶† [The mystery of why some people don‚Äôt get COVID](https://www.wired.com/story/the-mystery-of-why-some-people-dont-get-covid) // Appropriated for this week, an article in WEIRED on a study about why some people don‚Äôt get COVID. Interesting to think on how they are getting the study subjects, getting infected people is relatively easy (look at the hospitals), but how to find the healthy ones that haven‚Äôt been infected?
-  üìç [The underlying angst of Google Maps and Apple Maps](https://maphappenings.com/2022/08/18/maps-angst/) // An interesting take on some of the challenges Google and Apple Maps are facing, specially on being used to discover new places vs using TikTok or Instagram. It‚Äôs interesting to think about how do we search for new places, and whats the impact of social recommendations, rather than only looking for the closest place and scanning through menus.
