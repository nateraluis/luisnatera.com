Transition week. This week on the profesional side it was a transition one. Monday started by returning my laptop to my previous employer. The rest of the week was off, and enjoying the time.

On the personal side, it was a good one. I got to do some work on personal projects, and then got stucked with some Django issues using a Custom User model as a foreign key in another model. I think I know how to solve it, but it will have to wait a little bit until the next time.

Besides personal projects, I got to read during the week, I have been reading [the Brompton Book](https://www.brompton.com/shop/bike-accessories/the-brompton-engineering-for-change) on the story of the bike, and also about their business, it's an interesting one.

The week also came with good weather (personal note, I was already tired of clouds and rain), and fortunately, the sun was shining for [King's day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koningsdag), so we had a great party all around the city. This was my second King's day and it still amazes me how everyone goes outside to party and celebrate. It is really a party on the cities. Finally, the weekend continued with the good weather and we went for a long bike ride outside of Amsterdam one day, and a picnic on the other day, it was a full week!

On a professional side (bis), I got ready to get back to work on Monday, I'm very excited about joining [AerLabs](https://www.aerlabs.com/) as a software engineer working on the [echo platform](https://www.aerlabs.com/echo), and different projects! Looking forward to the fly! ðŸ˜‰
