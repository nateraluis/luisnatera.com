Last week was a short one. On work I finally merged some changes that took me longer than anticipated, but that provided good lessons on `HTMX` and Django. I have been finding very entertaining working across backend and frontend, being able to implement an idea the whole way is a nice feeling.

With the weather changing going out for a run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is becoming more of a challenge, but is a challenge that pays off, just look at this scene that I ran into it on my way back home:

The last week I also got more into [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) as an alternative to Twitter, specially after the whole Musk saga with Twitter. On a personal note, I really do not like Elon Musk. It is interesting to see what might happen, both with Twitter and Mastodon.

## Mastodon
-  üíª [toot a cli and tui for using mastodon in the terminal. With vim key bindings](https://github.com/ihabunek/toot) // Nice way to use mastodon in the terminal. If using `homebrew` is as easy as `brew install toot` to install it. Then `toot login` to authenticate, and finally: `toot post "hello world!"`. Give it a try. 
-  üåé [Earth‚Äôs submarine fiber optic cable network](https://fosstodon.org/@tylermorganwall/109293265470257641) // Nice visualization of the multiple fiber optic cables that provide connectivity around the world.
