## Mastodon
-  [toot a cli and tui for using mastodon in the terminal. With vim key bindings](https://github.com/ihabunek/toot) // Nice way to use mastodon in the terminal. If using `homebrew` is as easy as `brew install toot` to install it. Then `toot login` to authenticate, and finally: `toot post "hello world!"`. Give it a try.
