This is my first week in review, a collection of interesting things I have found in the web, twitter, or other places. This is also my first automated post (more about the technical side and how I did it in a future post), the idea is to use GitHub Issues as a placeholder for the ideas and links I find during the week, and then have a Github Action build a post out of those items.

Hopefully by Monday August 29th the post will be live in my blog ü§û.
