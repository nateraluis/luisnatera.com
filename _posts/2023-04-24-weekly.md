 Ch-ch-changes! 

This past week, the soundtrack to my life has been David Bowie's "Changes." Why, you ask? Well, it turns out that I've decided to make a big change in my life - I'm switching jobs! After a year and a half at my current company, I've accepted an offer from another organization and will be moving into a new role.

Looking back on my time with [Systemiq](https://systemiq.earth), I'm incredibly proud of the work I was able to do, the teams I had the pleasure of working with, and the numerous opportunities I had to contribute to a variety of projects. From building Python libraries and simulations to model decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors, to working on educational tools in the sustainable packaging industry and helping companies eliminate plastic waste, the ride was interesting, fulfilling and fun. Working alongside so many talented, caring, and intelligent people was an experience I will always treasure. On the technical side, I gained invaluable experience working on diverse topics and using my technical abilities to find solutions to difficult and urgent problems. I am confident that the work I did at Systemiq, and the work that my colleagues continue to do, will contribute to building better systems and driving us towards a more sustainable future. Thank you all for the great ride!

As for what's next, I plan to take a few days off before starting my new role, which I will talk more about next week. Rest assured, though, that I will continue to work in climate tech.

On the personal side, the week was a short one for me, as I had just returned from London (if you miss it, [you can read about London here](https://buttondown.email/natera/archive/week-in-review-2023-04-17/)). I spent the weekend catching up with friends and enjoying the Netherlands' beautiful tulips, which are in full bloom this time of year. We took a bike trip through the tulip fields and marveled at the vibrant colors - it's a sight that never gets old. The day was a classic Dutch mix of sun, wind, and rain, and of course, the day also had some bitterballen. One thing I always appreciate about the Netherlands is the convenience of traveling by train and taking a bike from the station - the integration between transport modes is beautiful and allows for extended trips like this one.

This week also came with its share of interesting links. Give them a look:
