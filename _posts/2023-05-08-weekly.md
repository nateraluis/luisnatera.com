## #bluesky](https://hachyderm.io/tags/bluesky)

 New work week! ✨ As with every change of jobs the first week has been a set up week, from setting up everything in my new computer, the development environment, gaining access the systems, and so on. As part of the set up, I tried to configure VScode, it didn’t go well, had to make multiple configurations and download various plugins to get it to half the state that I wanted. Vim + PyCharm are still the winning combo for my development needs, and now I'm up and running with the new set up 🤖. I'm impress by the Apple chips, this things fly, and are very quiet!

I have my new tasks, and now I'll be tipping my toes in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), looks very interesting. I'm looking forward to start coding and getting to learn more about it. It feels different from Django, but also has some similarities.
