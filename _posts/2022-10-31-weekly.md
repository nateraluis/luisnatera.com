Back in Amsterdam after three weeks in Mexico. It was really good to be back there, seeing family and friends. The way back was uneventful, and for the first time in a while I got some jet lag. Not a bad one, but still annoying to wake up in the middle of the night and have a couple of days feeling tired. But after two or three days it was back to normal.

On the work front I have been doing more full stack development, some Python for the backend and some HTMX and a little bit of JavaScript on the frontend. I have to say, HTMX is quite interesting and useful to write modern interfaces, allowing to update only certain areas of the `DOM` or updating with different behaviors certain elements. 

On personal and side projects, I have started a small one. Also Django based, and I am experimenting while setting everything from scratch. I am experimenting not only on the development side, but with GitHub actions, projects, and the different tools they provide. For this one I want to use `Tailwind` to get to know more about it and their take on CSS. Let‚Äôs build! üöÄ

Also, autumn is here üçÇ, as colorful as it gets.

- [My supervisor had a sign on his desk: ‚Äúpoor time management on your part, does not constitute an emergency on mine‚Äù. I often think about this and wonder how long it will be before those words leave my mouth on a last minute request teams call.](https://twitter.com/dataisawesomeo/status/1583527249017380864?s=61&t=pB5zUOq1yOAAiIAcJjQu5w) // During the last year I have been thinking about time management and time as a non-renewable resource. This quote really resonated.
