This past week was a quiet one. It started with COVID, fortunately the symptoms remained very mild, like a normal cold. So I spent mos of my week inside my home. On the work side it was also a good one, the code I worked on for the first six months of the year was open sourced, and a report where I participated (with the code for the simulations) was published. It is a nice feeling to see it out in the open. I'll make sure to write a dedicated post on the project and the results.

By the end of the week I tested negative again, so I went out. The biggest discovery of the week was a local taco stand in one of Amsterdam's markets. The tacos were really good, and the *taquero*, Luis, is a very cool guy. I'll definitely be coming back 🌮🤤

Interesting to think about city employees as part of songs, and how the experience that someone might have had with one public servant might end in a song.
