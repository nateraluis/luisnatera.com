## Web
-  [Population density maps of Egypt and Germany](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/14ec76k/oc_population_density_maps_egypt_germany/) // Always fascinating to see how population distributes in the territory. More in Egypt along the Nile.

## Youtube
-  [Tram EM 2023](https://youtu.be/ig7XmztpfA4) // The European Tramdriver Championship. I didn't know there is a championship between tramsdrivers, if you are going to watch a video today, make sure to watch this one! Trams playing bowling, precision parking, and more. Long live public transport and the people who drive it! ðŸšŠ
