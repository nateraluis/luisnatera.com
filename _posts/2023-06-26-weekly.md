Warm week, I know, it seems that I have been writing/complaining about the weather for a while, but it has been one of the warmest months in Mexico. If Iâ€™m worried bout something in the future is climate change. Some days I can be optimistic and think that as humanity we will get our act together and figure it out. But right now Iâ€™m not that optimistic. As long as we continue to grow following a capital, and personal oriented trajectory, versus a more conscious and social one, I donâ€™t think we will have a bright future (or probably will be too bright and warm).

On the professional side, its great to work on the intersection of sustainability and software development. Trying to contribute to a better future. On a non abstract approach, that meant writing Alembic migrations for a FastAPI project, and making sure that the changes I implemented are not going to break production. Everything seems to be working accordingly, so Iâ€™ll call it a great week! ðŸ˜€

This week the collection of links is a little bit short, but make sure to watch the Youtube video on the European Tramdriver Championship.
