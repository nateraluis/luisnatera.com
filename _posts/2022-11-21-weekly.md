Last week I was out of work for two days, I got some flu/influenza that putted me out of circulation for a couple of days. 

Once I recovered and got back to work, I got to play with Django and html forms. I used this opportunity to write my first [TIL -Today I Learned- post](https://luisnatera.com/posts/2022/11/til-connecting-html-forms-to-django-forms/). I will be gritting more TILs, they provide a good way to document what I have been learning along the projects I work, and are an opportunity to share the knowledge I acquire.
