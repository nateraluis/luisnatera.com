Welcome back to the regular week overview. This one was not a particular exciting one, it was normal. We all know a normal week. At least at work it was a regular one that went by. The usual tasks, some coding, debugging, managing and the usual Agile board(s).

For the personal projects it was a more interesting one. As you might remember, I recently decided to build a web application to solve one of my issues with crossposting and managing hashtags. This week had some progress on that end. I'm really enjoying getting back to coding with Django, and the full integration between back and front end. Django + HTMX is the perfect combo. I really don't get the appeal to work with React and all those big front end frameworks. Anyway. I'm happy that I'm using Django again. I had missed it.

Finally, the photography side. During the week I shared some recent, and not so recent photos. I like to go back and check some of my previous shots. Not only to see how I framed and approach a certain shot, but also to discover some images that might have been discarded at the moment. 

How often do you go back to see some of your previous work? Have learn something new recently from looking to something you did in the past? Let me know, I'm interested. For me, one of those experiences was reviewing the photos I shared in the past newsletter issue. Getting to see how I approached the shots, got me thinking on what would I do different now.

And now, some links:

I made a little playground and you can also download all the fonts I made there: https://aresluna.org/pixel-fonts/](https://mastodon.online/@mwichary/114252237460400950)

-  [I promise all of you that, no matter what level of creative talent you may or may not think you have, I'd much, much rather see a post of something you made yourself than a post of something you had a generative AI thing cobble together out of other people's stuff while burning another chunk of the Earth.](https://hackers.town/@Rob_T_Firefly/114235674830122861)
-  [Some times, while I solve a Git merge conflict, I will see something else and fix that, too... then it all goes into the merge commit.It's my gitty pleasure](https://social.data.coop/@benjaoming/114228309360194278)
