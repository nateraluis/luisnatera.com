This past week was a good one. Work wise, it was mostly focus on coding, and some administrative tasks. Nothing too exciting to made it into the review.

On the personal side, last week I flew to Mexico, it is good to be home. Even if we have only been here for a couple of days, we have managed to meet family and friends, it has been really nice to see, and hug them. I am sure that the next weeks will be full with laughs and good times.

As the trip was coming, I did not have too much time to collect more links, so there is only one for this week. But, to compensate here is a picture of the sunrise while arriving to Guadalajara.
