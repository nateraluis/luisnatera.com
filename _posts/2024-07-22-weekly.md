New week in review. As I [wrote last week](https://buttondown.email/natera/archive/months-in-review/), I'm coming back from the writing hibernation.

On this past week, I spend much of my working time coding. I missed it. At work, we got together to have a hackathon/mini-sprint to fully focus on one project and move from 0 to prototype. It was very fun to get to start working on something new, starting from a blank canvas, and by the end of the third day, have a working prototype.  Part of the fun was the speed on which we developed, iterating rapidly to get some basic functionalities in place that allowed us to tell a story with the tool. The story telling part is a key feature when developing a prototype, at the end of the day we need to be able to show the tool, and make a compiling business case of it, thus having a clear story gives guidance on what features to prioritize to have them working, and which ones can be mock-ups, or have a supporting role.

Besides coding for work, I also got to code for side projects. I'm working on a platform to showcase some geospatial data, and this week I got to do some work on it. The focus of the week was to have a deployed environment. I got to use AWS Lightsail to store a Django app in a container. I'll make sure to write more about it, but I'm happy with the result of the week, a deployed application, including GeoDjango and all the geo-dependecies, and a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub.

Overall it was a very positive coding week!

On the personal side. This week we finally had summer weather in Amsterdam! With multiple days going above 25Â°C it was the perfect weather to be outside. So we did. This included going to the park to spend some time under the sun, and enjoying a drink. Going to a BBQ to celebrate the birthday of two friends with more friends, great food and drinks. A great way to spend a Saturday!

Finally, one of my favorite activities in this city has been getting on a boat, and this week also had this activity. There's something special about enjoying a city from the water, just going into a boat with friends, and navigating the different canals while enjoying the company, some good drinks and laughs. It was [gezellig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezelligheid).

This was a long week in review. I guess my hands were itching to write, as I haven't write in a long time hehe.

Here are some interesting links I found along the week, hope you enjoy reading it, and find the links interesting!
