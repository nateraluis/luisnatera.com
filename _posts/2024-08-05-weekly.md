Software development, Olympics, and Amsterdam Pride week. This week had everything. Let's start with the work side of things. I have been working on our main product, and this week included getting to build the foundations for a new feature. It's always fun to start something new, and I'm excited to see how the feature will turn out in a couple of weeks. Part of the work included some refactoring, making sure that the code is well structured and ready to keep adding new features. This also included some work on the database migrations, to ensure the database compatibility with the new feature. Overall, a good week at work.

Besides work, the week has been full of events. Summer always is. The Olympics are in full swing, and I've been watching some of the events. The tennis had great matches, and the final with Alcaraz VS. Djokovic was amazing. Three hours of great tennis! For next week, I'm looking forward to the track and field events.

Finally the week ended with the Amsterdam Pride Parade. Last week was Amsterdam Pride week, and the parade by the end of it is always a great event. A party and celebration of love and diversity across Amsterdam canals. The parade was full of boats, music, and people celebrating. As the years that I have attended, this also included a boat from Amsterdam police, the fire department, and the army. It's great live in a city that celebrates diversity and inclusion, a city that is open to everyone.

That's it for this week. Enjoy the photos and links from this week!
