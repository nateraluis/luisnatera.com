## Bicycle](https://fosstodon.org/@lisahornung/112869622088774138)
- #Mastodon [Came across an interesting paper tracking global bicycle ownership. ðŸš² ðŸŒŽ 42% of households own at least one bicycle = 580m+ bicycles worldwide.  Countries were clustered into groups of similar ownership rates.Based on data from 150 countries, 1989-2012. Not sure if anything like it has since been done. Would be cool to see if/how things have changed.#Dataviz made with #python #matplotlib #pypalettes. Code: https://github.com/Lisa-Ho/small-data-projects?tab=readme-ov-file#072024-global-bike-ownership Paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214140515006787 #cycling
