 Second week working from Mexico. It has been really good to get to see so many family and friends, enjoy some warm weather before going back to the Amsterdam rain, and getting to eat so many good food!

The work week was a good one, tackling some tickets and getting to learn more about how to use HTMX in Django, and how to make sure that the application works even when the browser has JavaScript disabled. This week, I also worked on some backend logic for the application and tackling some corner behaviors, it is always a good excessive to think about all the possibilities of how people might interact with the application.

On the personal week, it was full of friends and family. We have been meeting every day with some one and making the best of our time in Mexico. It is always great to be here!

-  ðŸš² [What if Apple made an e-bike](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/what-if-apple-made-an-e-bike?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) // An article thinking about the possibility of apple making an e-bike, something that I think is a little bit far away from becoming true. Although, it would be very interesting to see their take on e-bikes and I am sure that doing one will definitely help as a push to more sustainable transport options.
