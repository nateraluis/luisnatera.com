It’s been a long time since the last email I sent. There’s a saying in Mexico: “He wasn’t dead, he was just partying”, and certainly I’m not dead, wasn’t really partying either (although there were some parties along spring). I guess it was just life that went through. But I’m back.

Personal

Let’s make this one a spring 🌼 in review. Since the last time I wrote things have been moving, on the personal side it was a spring with some trips, getting to see family and friends, and getting to know new places.

Along those trips I decided pick-up my camera again, and started taking more pictures. Unsurprisingly, after some years without using it, one of my lenses doesn’t work anymore, thus I have been taking pictures just with a 50mm lens. It has been a joy to force myself to take pictures with a fix lens. It makes the process more conscious, as I know there is a limitation in the camera and on the range I can take on. I have been enjoying it.

Here are some of the pictures I took in the last couple of months:

Work

Work has been going well. It has been one year already since I joined [AerLabs](https://aerlabs.com). During these months I have been working in multiple projects, and developing our main product. I have taken over some responsibilities on project management, and overall I’m enjoying creating great software, with an even greater team.

On the technical side,
