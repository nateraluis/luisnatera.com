The government of Amsterdam recently [launched a campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/world/europe/amsterdam-uk-tourists-stay-away.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) to get people not to come to the city. The campaign is targeting certain type of tourism that has been getting too popular in the city, the stag parties groups. People who come to the city to get drunk, go to the coffee shops and the red light district. 

**TODO: Insert video.**

The campaign has added more fuel to the debate about what type of tourism, and how much tourism does it wants to attract. It is good to think about the impact of tourism in the city, although the tourism has an impact in the city’s economy, it also comes with different consequences for the city’s inhabitants. Specially, the party tourism is quite disrupting for the locals, not only for the noise pollution from, but from having people behaving in a poor way.

Would it be possible to use some other means to control the problem, rather than trying to stop people to come to the city? I think the first step pass on understanding the city, and the different tourism dynamics that happen on it. Take for example the case of Andorra, a country with 8 million visitors per year (very impressive for a country with just over 76,000 people), and where tourism represents around 46% of Andorra’s economy. 

One way to understand such dynamics is to use mobile phone data, and urban attributes, such as points of interest. [One study](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/reversed-urbanism/overview/) by the City Science group of the MIT Media Lab, used machine learning and anonymized telecom data, to understand how the population move, and which parts of the city are attracting
