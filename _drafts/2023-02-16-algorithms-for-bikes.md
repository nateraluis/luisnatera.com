Recently I wrote about how [fragment bicycle infrastructure](https://buttondown.email/natera/archive/connected-or-fragmented-analyzing-the-state-of/) can be (If you din't get the email, make sure to [subscribe here](https://buttondown.email/natera)), even Amsterdam has some missing connections in its bicycle network, although not as many as London. Getting to know that the network is not complete is the first step towards having a good bicycle infrastructure network. The next step? Connect it.

Intro to algorithms to connect bike networks, different approaches. (misi)

Using the existing network, an finding the shortest connection. Minimize the investment.
