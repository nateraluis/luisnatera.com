## Introduction
- Definition of 15-minute cities: a city planning concept in which all necessary goods, services, and amenities are accessible within a 15-minute radius or less
- Importance of urban mobility in today's society: cities are increasingly facing challenges related to traffic congestion, air pollution, and accessibility for all citizens

## What are 15-minute cities?
- Concept of accessibility within a 15-minute radius: the idea is that individuals should be able to reach the places they need to go within a short distance, promoting sustainability and reducing reliance on personal vehicles
- Examples of cities implementing 15-minute city initiatives: Paris, France and Vancouver, Canada have both announced plans to become 15-minute cities

## Leveraging software and location intelligence
- Role of technology in enabling 15-minute cities: software and location intelligence tools can help planners and policymakers analyze data on mobility patterns, public transit usage, and the availability of amenities to inform decision-making and design of 15-minute city initiatives
- Examples of software and location intelligence tools being used in urban mobility planning: GIS mapping software and transit app data can be used to visualize and analyze accessibility in cities

## Reimagining urban mobility
- Potential benefits of 15-minute cities for residents and cities as a whole: increased accessibility and mobility for all citizens, reduced traffic congestion and air pollution, and potentially increased economic activity in local neighborhoods
- Challenges and considerations in implementing 15-minute city initiatives: potential challenges include funding, political support, and balancing the needs of different neighborhoods and stakeholders

## Conclusion
- Recap of key points: 15-minute cities aim to increase accessibility and sustainability in urban areas through the use of software and location intelligence tools
- Future potential for 15-minute cities as a model for urban mobility: as cities continue to grapple with issues related to urban mobility, the 15-minute city concept offers a promising approach for improving the livability and sustainability of urban areas.
