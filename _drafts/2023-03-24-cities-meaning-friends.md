Last year I got interviewed for the WTF Cities podcast by Fanni Melles, and at some point of the talk I told her that cities meant friends for me (for the rest of the talk, make sure to listen to it, and in the meantime listen to her podcast ðŸ˜‰). Coincidentally, I got to travel the next day after the interview to my hometown, and for the two weeks at home I kept reflecting about this connection between cities and friends, so this will be a bit more personal essay rather than a highlight of a technical project or a more in deep writing.

Every time I think about a city in the world, I think about whom do I know living in the given city, or who could have friends living there. I guess, I have this new habit since moving to live abroad, getting to know more people in different cities where I have lived, and more specifically getting to knwo more international people in those cities, people that, as me, were in the given space for a specific period of time.

Now when I heard about Budapest, I got to think of all the friends I did while living there during the Ph.D., the people that was already living there, and are still living in the city, but also I get to think about those who already moved, thus increasing the number associations between cities and people. It is no longer only the ones who are living in the city, is also the ones who were there and now are in some other places, thus new cities in the map.
