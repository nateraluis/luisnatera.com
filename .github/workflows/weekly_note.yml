            This is an automated issue to track the weekly post for [luisnatera.com/blog](https://luisnatera.com/blog).
            The issue works as a repository for the links and thoughts to be published by the end of the week.

            This is a first step in automating the publication process, the second step is to retrive the comments from the issue and create, automatically, the post and publish it.
