<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a Ph.D. candidate of network science at the <a href="https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/" target="_blank"> Department of Network and Data Science </a> at the Central European University, in Budapest, Hungary. My research revolves around urban mobility in multiplex urban networks, bridging urban planning and complex systems. Currently, I am working on multiplex urban fingerprints for bicycle network planning. I have experience working in academic, government and private sectors.
